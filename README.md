# KOA-Web-Application
# For this project we were tasked with creating weather stations to deploy and upload the data collected to our Flask app
# This project file includes all of the front-end development involved including a weekly, monthly, and mobile weather view
# Developers are able to view their dashboard and look at data as it is coming in as well as past weather data
# The user is able to change the weather station they are viewing at the drop down menu on the mobile view column
# This flask app uses primarily a combination of html, css, and javascript to carry out the design and layout of the website as well as time and data handling
# We pull from our MongoDB in order to show the user and developers data in a presentable format
